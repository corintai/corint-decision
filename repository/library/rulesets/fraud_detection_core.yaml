  name: Core Fraud Detection Ruleset
  description: |
    Reusable fraud detection ruleset with 6 common fraud patterns.

    Each rule detects a specific fraud pattern and contributes a score:
    1. Fraud Farm (100pts) - High IP/device association
    2. Account Takeover (85pts) - New device + failed logins + location change
    3. Velocity Abuse (70pts) - Transaction frequency spikes
    4. Amount Outlier (75pts) - Statistical anomaly
    5. Suspicious Geography (60pts) - Impossible travel
    6. New User Fraud (50pts) - Recent account + suspicious behavior

    Decision logic uses pattern combinations and score thresholds.

  # Reference imported rules by their IDs
  rules:
    - fraud_farm_pattern
    - account_takeover_pattern
    - velocity_abuse_pattern
    - amount_outlier_pattern
    - suspicious_geography_pattern
    - new_user_fraud_pattern

  # Multi-layer decision logic
  conclusion:
    # ==========================================
    # Priority 1: Critical Patterns
    # ==========================================

    # Fraud farm is always critical - organized fraud
    - when: triggered_rules contains "fraud_farm_pattern"
      signal: decline
      reason: "Critical: Fraud farm detected (organized fraud network)"

    # Multiple high-severity patterns combined
    - when: |
        triggered_rules contains "account_takeover_pattern" &&
        triggered_rules contains "amount_outlier_pattern"
      signal: decline
      reason: "Critical: Account takeover with abnormal transaction amount"

    # ==========================================
    # Priority 2: Score-Based Thresholds
    # ==========================================

    # Critical Risk >= 200 (multiple patterns)
    - when: total_score >= 200
      signal: decline
      reason: "Critical risk - multiple fraud indicators (score: {total_score})"

    # Very High Risk >= 150
    - when: total_score >= 150
      signal: decline
      reason: "Very high risk - strong fraud pattern (score: {total_score})"

    # High Risk >= 100
    - when: total_score >= 100
      signal: decline
      reason: "High risk - clear fraud signals (score: {total_score})"

    # Medium-High Risk >= 60
    - when: total_score >= 60
      signal: review
      reason: "Medium-high risk - manual review required (score: {total_score})"

    # Medium Risk >= 30
    - when: total_score >= 30
      signal: review
      reason: "Medium risk - enhanced monitoring (score: {total_score})"

    # ==========================================
    # Priority 3: Count-Based Decisions
    # ==========================================

    # Multiple fraud signals present
    - when: triggered_count >= 3
      signal: review
      reason: "Multiple fraud indicators ({triggered_count} patterns detected)"

    # ==========================================
    # Priority 4: Default Action
    # ==========================================

    # Low Risk (default)
    - default: true
      signal: approve
      reason: "Low risk - normal pattern"

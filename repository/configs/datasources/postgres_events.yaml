# PostgreSQL SQL Database Configuration
# Stores risk control events and decisions for feature calculation
#
# Note: This datasource is for FEATURE CALCULATION (business events).
# Server-level datasources (repository storage) are defined in config/server.yaml.
#
# Small deployments: Can use same database as server.yaml (but must configure separately)
# Large deployments: Use dedicated database for events (recommended for scalability)

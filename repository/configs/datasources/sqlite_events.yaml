# SQLite Database Configuration
# Stores risk control events for feature calculation
#
# Note: This datasource is for FEATURE CALCULATION (business events).
# Server-level datasources (repository storage) are defined in config/server.yaml.
#
# SQLite is suitable for:
# - Development and testing
# - Small deployments with low event volume
# - Single-server deployments without high concurrency

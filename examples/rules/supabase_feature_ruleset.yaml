# Supabase Feature-Based Risk Control Ruleset
# This ruleset demonstrates how to use calculated features in rule conditions

# ========================================
# STAGE 1: RISK DETECTION RULES
# ========================================
# Rules that reference features calculated from Supabase data

  when:
    event.type: transaction
    conditions:
      - transaction_sum_7d > 5000
      - transaction_count_24h > 10

  score: 50

rule:
  id: multiple_devices
  name: Multiple Device Usage
  description: User accessing from multiple devices in short time

# Rule 4: Rapid Transaction Frequency
rule:
  id: rapid_transactions
  name: Rapid Transaction Frequency
  description: Too many transactions in short time window

  when:
    event.type: transaction
    conditions:
      - transaction_count_24h > 20

  score: 45

# Rule 5: Suspicious Device Pattern
rule:
  id: suspicious_device_pattern
  name: Suspicious Device Pattern
  description: User accessing from multiple devices with high transaction volume

  when:
    event.type: transaction
    conditions:

# ========================================
# STAGE 2: DECISION RULESET
# ========================================

ruleset:
  id: supabase_risk_assessment
  name: Supabase Feature-Based Risk Assessment
  description: |
    Risk assessment ruleset that uses features calculated from Supabase PostgreSQL database.
    Features are computed in real-time from event data stored in Supabase.

  rules:
    - high_transaction_volume
    - multiple_devices
    - high_value_transaction
    - rapid_transactions
    - suspicious_device_pattern

  decision_logic:
    # Critical risk - immediate block
    - condition: triggered_rules contains "suspicious_device_pattern"
      action: deny
      reason: "BLOCKED: Suspicious device pattern with high transaction volume detected"
      terminate: true

    # High risk score threshold
    - condition: total_score >= 100
      action: deny
      reason: "High risk score - transaction denied"
      terminate: true

    # Multiple risk indicators
    - condition: triggered_count >= 3
      action: challenge
      reason: "Multiple risk indicators detected - require additional verification"
      terminate: true

    # Medium-high risk
    - condition: total_score >= 80
      action: challenge
      reason: "Medium-high risk - require verification"
      terminate: true

    # Medium risk
    - condition: total_score >= 35
      action: review
      reason: "Medium risk - manual review required"
      terminate: true

    # Low risk (default)
    - default: true
      action: approve
      reason: "Low risk - transaction approved"
